    "char1": "Character 1 is a strong dps that handles a big chunk of the party's damage.\nHe has a great skillset that provides consistent damage output, as well as amazing counters and stagger metrics.\nWhile he is short-mid range, he has a variety of mobility skills that let him close the gap fairly easily.\nBut he does have lower health and defense, and combined with the fact that he works best in the short range, a mistake could be fatal.\nAdditionally, to reach his full damage potential, he needs to hit back attacks, which makes him a difficult character to work with, and as a result, makes him a middling tier character"
