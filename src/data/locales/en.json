While her pokes are great, you will see more value from a well-timed, quick poke than spamming it all the time.\nHer stance, destroyer form, is a highly offensive stance that prevents Alisa from ducking or dashing. However, she can fly around with chainsaw powered attacks that are advantageous on block.\nAlisa's main gameplan is on the simple side, but if you want to utilize the chainsaw form heavily, there may be more to memorize.\nShe does fall behind similar characters in terms of damage and combo potential so she is rarer in a tournament setting.\nUltimately, Alisa is a great, beginner friendly character for all the robo-girl enjoyers!",

He has great punishes, panic moves, and moves that combo on counter hits.\nArmor King's variety of grabs make sure the enemy crouches often, which he can take advantage of with his many safe mid options.\nIt is to be noted, however, that all of this only come into play if you have great movement - Armor King's aggression potential relies on wavedashing, and he lacks low attacks that knocks down the opponent.\nUltimately, Armor King is definitely a great character with strong combos and grabs as well as being cool incarnate, but his difficult gameplan makes him more of an advanced character.",

In best(worst?) case scenarios, Bob can carry the opponent to the wall and end the game there in the blink of an eye.\nBob is definitely a strong, fun, exciting character to play, but his pickrate does not reflect that, presumably due to his bulkier body.\nUltimately, Bob has a simpler gameplan but with some execution barriers, so he is recommended to players who are more used to the Tekken system.",

Bryan also happens to be the symbolic character of Knee, the best Tekken player in the world\nBryan's moves generally pack a punch, and his decent wall carry makes him lethal. Bryan's taunt disable's the opponent's guard and lets him chain together a basically unblockable attack.\nThis makes Bryan especially strong in situations where he has a frame advantage - such as oki situations or after a successful punish, where he can mix up the opponent with his high damage moves.\nHowever, these situations are hard to create because Bryan's movement can be hard to execute, and there are no gimmicky, abusable moves, and his main attacks are relatively slow.\nWhile Bryan doesn't have particularly difficult execution and a easy to understand gameplan, the gameplan is hard to actually get right, making him frustrating if you are just starting to play the game.",

While most of the cast mixup the mids and lows, Claudio mixes up the highs and mids.\nClaudio has a variety of great mids to compliment this, most of which are even stronger at the wall. His hopkick has ome of the best hitboxes in the game, which lets him take advantage of his opponents' haphazard attempts to take back control.\nClaudio's Starburst form unlocks more damaging moves, letting him put on even more pressure.

Combined with his difficult execution requirement, these are some reasons we see less Devil Jin in tournaments today.\nEven so, Devil Jin has a great pressure from wavedash and plenty of tools to dish out damage.\nUltimately, because of the execution barrier and lower returns, Devil Jin is not recommended for players new to Tekken.",

However, Eddy does struggle with a lack of good sidestep, and many of his setups will not work against an experienced opponent, which make it a struggle to actually learn Tekken with Eddy.\nTherefore, Eddy is recommended to more experienced players looking for a challenge, or completely new players that just want a slight dip into what Tekken is like",

She is still a very difficult character that requires a lot of mechanical prowess and gameplay knowledge to play well, however, as most of her moves don't have a lot of damage.\nFor the mentioned reasons, Eliza is ultimately recommended to experienced players that are looking for a vampire character with flashy combos, and is not recommended for beginners.",

His strong low poke and a plethora of plus frame moves can let him take perfect rounds as he forces the opponent to keep guessing when their turn is.\nHis flashy, diverse, strong combos really add to the fun of playing Hwoarang. Hwoarang's launchers have a very good risk/reward ratio and are almost spammable. Additionally, he has great close and mid range tools that can really shake up the opponent.\nUnfortunately, Hwoarang does not benefit from a defensive playstyle as he has weaker punish, and his stances leave him unable to block. As such, Hwoarang may have trouble taking back the tempo after losing it.\nUltimately, Hwoarang is recommended for advanced players as he requires a lot of memorization in addition to a challenging execution barrier.",
