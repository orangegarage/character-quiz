While her pokes are great, you will see more value from a well-timed, quick poke than spamming it all the time.\nHer stance, destroyer form, is a highly offensive stance that prevents Alisa from ducking or dashing. However, she can fly around with chainsaw powered attacks that are advantageous on block.\nAlisa's main gameplan is on the simple side, but if you want to utilize the chainsaw form heavily, there may be more to memorize.\nShe does fall behind similar characters in terms of damage and combo potential so she is rarer in a tournament setting.\nUltimately, Alisa is a great, beginner friendly character for all the robo-girl enjoyers!",

He has great punishes, panic moves, and moves that combo on counter hits.\nArmor King's variety of grabs make sure the enemy crouches often, which he can take advantage of with his many safe mid options.\nIt is to be noted, however, that all of this only come into play if you have great movement - Armor King's aggression potential relies on wavedashing, and he lacks low attacks that knocks down the opponent.\nUltimately, Armor King is definitely a great character with strong combos and grabs as well as being cool incarnate, but his difficult gameplan makes him more of an advanced character.",

In best(worst?) case scenarios, Bob can carry the opponent to the wall and end the game there in the blink of an eye.\nBob is definitely a strong, fun, exciting character to play, but his pickrate does not reflect that, presumably due to his bulkier body.\nUltimately, Bob has a simpler gameplan but with some execution barriers, so he is recommended to players who are more used to the Tekken system.",

Bryan also happens to be the symbolic character of Knee, the best Tekken player in the world\nBryan's moves generally pack a punch, and his decent wall carry makes him lethal. Bryan's taunt disable's the opponent's guard and lets him chain together a basically unblockable attack.\nThis makes Bryan especially strong in situations where he has a frame advantage - such as oki situations or after a successful punish, where he can mix up the opponent with his high damage moves.\nHowever, these situations are hard to create because Bryan's movement can be hard to execute, and there are no gimmicky, abusable moves, and his main attacks are relatively slow.\nWhile Bryan doesn't have particularly difficult execution and a easy to understand gameplan, the gameplan is hard to actually get right, making him frustrating if you are just starting to play the game.",

While most of the cast mixup the mids and lows, Claudio mixes up the highs and mids.\nClaudio has a variety of great mids to compliment this, most of which are even stronger at the wall. His hopkick has ome of the best hitboxes in the game, which lets him take advantage of his opponents' haphazard attempts to take back control.\nClaudio's Starburst form unlocks more damaging moves, letting him put on even more pressure.

Combined with his difficult execution requirement, these are some reasons we see less Devil Jin in tournaments today.\nEven so, Devil Jin has a great pressure from wavedash and plenty of tools to dish out damage.\nUltimately, because of the execution barrier and lower returns, Devil Jin is not recommended for players new to Tekken.",

However, Eddy does struggle with a lack of good sidestep, and many of his setups will not work against an experienced opponent, which make it a struggle to actually learn Tekken with Eddy.\nTherefore, Eddy is recommended to more experienced players looking for a challenge, or completely new players that just want a slight dip into what Tekken is like",

She is still a very difficult character that requires a lot of mechanical prowess and gameplay knowledge to play well, however, as most of her moves don't have a lot of damage.\nFor the mentioned reasons, Eliza is ultimately recommended to experienced players that are looking for a vampire character with flashy combos, and is not recommended for beginners.",

Hwoarang's launchers have a very good risk/reward ratio and are almost spammable. Additionally, he has great close and mid range tools that can really shake up the opponent.\nUnfortunately, Hwoarang does not benefit from a defensive playstyle as he has weaker punish, and his stances leave him unable to block. As such, Hwoarang may have trouble taking back the tempo after losing it.\nUltimately, Hwoarang is recommended for advanced players as he requires a lot of memorization in addition to a challenging execution barrier.",

    "flavortext": "Paul has never missed a Tekken series in his life, which further cemented his iconic single-hit move: the Deathfist.\nPaul's deathfist/demoman mixup is a top tier mixup with one of the best returns in Tekken 7, but he doesn't stop there. Paul has amazing launcher options that have great hitboxes.\nAnd as Paul, your damage is so high that you can never truly be counted out of the game. He has great punishes that leaves you in advantageous situations as well as counterhit launchers that you can just spray and pray.\nPaul's simple win condition, simple combo, honest mixups, and a variety of panic moves give him things to do in all situations.\nBut as a result, Paul is a very popular character especially in lower ranks, and chances are high that the opponent will know your setups and move properties already. Paul's backdashing also leaves some things to be desired.\nFrom a newer player's perspective, Paul is an amazing character armed with high damage and mixups that let you reap the benefits after a short amount of practice.",

    "name": "Sergei Dragunov",
    "flavortext": "Dragunov has two main moves that make his world go 'round, the d2 and wr2.\nWith those moves as the main, Dragunov's gameplan involves using his decent movement and low to slowly chip down the opponent's health.\nDragunov has relatively simple commands and not a lot of main moves, so you can learn him quickly. However, he doesn't really have big damage options and has constantly struggled with weak strings and wonky hitboxes that created quite a few frustrating situations.\nAlthough his d2 is an amzing low, he doesn't really have another strong low to compliment it, so it is harder than expected to open up the opponent for your mids.\nBecause of these drawbacks, Dragunov is considered a weaker character in the professional level, but he used to be a very strong character commonly seen in tournaments in the earlier seasons, and is a great character to learn Tekken fundamentals with.\nUltimately, if you are willing to take on the frustrations that come with the benefits, Dragunov is a great character for players on all levels.",

    "flavortext": "Shaheen's glory days are far, far away, in the original arcade cabinets in some Round One, but he is still the well-rounded, versatile, honest character he was back then.\nMost of Shaheen's fundamental moves are very good and combined with his above average movement, it is easy to get whiff punishes.\nShaheen also has decent frame punishes from standing and crouching, but he also has aggressive options through his sliding mixup or hopkick. Using this versatility, Shaheen excels at taking the game slowly, snowballing small leads into victories.\nShaheen does have a bit of an execution barrier, and lacks in the ability to poke at enemies in midrange, which limits the space in which his positives can shine through.\nAs such, Shaheen is very good at solidifying leads, but lacks the power to 'punch up' against strong players.\nOverall, Shaheen is an advanced character that recommended to players with more Tekken experience.",

However, Steve's high execution barrier and limited low options make it very hard for him to play out the round proactively.\nEven seasoned players find it challenging to pick up this advanced character, so if you are new to the game Steve can definitely be very frustrating to learn.",

    "flavortext": "Xiaoyu may look cute from a distance, but get any closer and she's going to dodge you with AOP and mix you up until you're dead. Disgusting!\nXiaoyu has short fundamental moves but they are very good aside from that. She excels at throwing out moves that can't be punished, then pressuring with her stance. She has a good mix of high, mid, and low attacks, and has a lot of strings that make it very hard to escape once the mixups start.\nXiaoyu is also good at comebacks and looking for big counterhit damage thanks to her Art Of Phoenix and backturn stance, which both have great mixup, counterhit combos, and evasive options. At rage mode, Xiaoyu uses her rage drive to power up her backturn mixup and definitely has potential for big comebacks.\nShe does struggle with her short reach and lacks ways to close the gap, sometimes making it hard to keep up with the opponents' damage.\nOverall, Xiaoyu has simple, easy commands and combos and a gameplan that benefits her the more you press, making it one of the easier characters to get into Tekken with.",

    "flavortext": "Yoshimitsu has a sword, yes, but he would would rather just use it as a pogo stick as he hops up and down and fart noxious gas clouds. Did that make sense? Because a lot of what Yoshimitsu does doesn't.\nYoshimitsu has a decent whiff punish game and his punishes put him in an advantageous situation, so he is a very good defensive character, but he can (and is famous when) play a good aggressive game through various evasive moves and stances.\nYoshimitsu has a lot of unblockable moves to use and has a very strong mixup at the wall. His moves become different depending on whether he has his sword out or in.\nYoshimitsu has a signature move called 'flash' that is one of the shortest and fastest moves in the game and rewards a strong counterhit playstyle. Aside from that, Yoshimitsu has a variety of unique moves such as ones that let you avoid the opponent's attack by taking damage, or ones that slowly let you heal up from a backturn stance. Many Yoshimitsu setups revolve around using these wonky moves, so Yoshimitsu has potential only capped by the player.\nWhile he can be fun, his fundamental moves have low damage and he does have a weaker punish, which make him harder to be in control when fighting honestly.\nHis combo routes are versatile and fun, but there is definitely some execution barrier, and as Yoshimitsu requires quick thinking in addition to that, it can be very frustrating to start with Yoshimitsu.\nAs such, it is recommended to party with Yoshimitsu only if you are a more experienced Tekken player.",

In the higher ranks, Zafina's gimmicks from stances do not work for the most part, but her amazing movement lets her play Tekken in a versatile way.\nZafina's base movement and long pokes let her whiff punish very easily, and she has many strings that chip down the opponent and fish for big counterhit damage.\nIn fact, all Zafina's tools are amazing except she does not have a 15 frame launcher, making her a popular choice amongst professional players.\nHowever, her moveset strength stem purely from her movement, so there is a lot to study compared to other characters, and it can get very taxing to play her for long sets.\nIf you are looking to play a movement based character that offers versatile options, Zafina may be the character for you.",
